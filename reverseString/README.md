You are to write a function that returns the reverse of the string provided.
If the reverse of the string is the same as the original string, as in the case of _palindromes_, return true instead.

Return `null` when the string provided is empty.


## Instructions

Remember that passing code is just the first step. The goal is to work
towards a solution that is as readable and expressive as you can make
it.

Please make your solution as general as possible. Good code doesn't just
pass the test suite, it works with any input that fits the
specification.

Have fun!
